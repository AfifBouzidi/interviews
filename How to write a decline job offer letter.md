Example:
> Hi John, 
>
> I thought over your offer and that's what I've got in the end:
> I was totally excited about the whole process of interviews and I must say your team has a great experience in doing technical interviews. 
> 
> It was difficult for me to make a final decision
> Probably, I have to decline this job offer due to several reasons:
> 1. Salary expectations
>  
> That's almost as much as I am making right now working in the office and I would rather expect a higher salary when switching to remote.
>
> 2. Immaturity
>
>I believe you are looking for someone more mature in terms of making decisions. I feel like I still need a lot of mentoring, pair programming sessions, etc to become stand-alone. Talking about that, it seems better for me to stay in the office for some more time here in Lviv.
> 
> 
> What I want to add is that I highly appreciate your time and an offer itself and I would really like to stay in touch in order to arrange possible collaboration further - probably in a half of a year I will be ready to start working 100% remotely. Thank you for your consideration. 
> 
> BR,
> Dmytro.

# But...
* Always keep the door open - give employer an opportunity to affect your decision by changing the variables - salary, flexibility of schedule, etc. Always leave an opportunity to continue negotiating. You must become a master of verbal karate to keep this communication clear and understandable. I believe, clearing your concerns is the best thing you can do during the negotiating process and let employer satisfy these concerns.
* Spread the positive vibe - keep your communication positive and stay excited about each offer you get. That's extremely important when you are able to show your attitude so employer can notice one more time your general ability to work in team and spread positive vibes and inspire everyone. There are a lot of shitty offers - there is nothing to it. But once you start negotiating you will be able to improve an offer by showing your professional skills of communication which is highly valuable at any level. In the end, current offer might be based on some limitations of customer and project, but only if you were able to impress employer with such professional offer decline, you will be first in line when these limitations will be weakened. 
* Remember: your goal is to give way. You must be beatable in negotiation. It's not a challenge which you must win and always up the stakes. The best you can do is to give company a clear path how to get you working for them: salary N, working schedule of X hours/month, library at the office, technical meetups Y times a year, shower, Z displays, etc. Try to stop this bullshit game you might think of. That's not a game - that's business with risks and business people try to calculate everything. Give them this chance.
