Example:
> Hi John, 
>
> I thought over your offer and that's what I've got in the end:
> I was totally excited about the whole process of interviews and I must say your team has a great experience in doing technical interviews. 
> 
> It was difficult for me to make a final decision
> Probably, I have to decline this job offer due to several reasons:
> 1. Salary expectations
>  
> That's almost as much as I am making right now working in the office and I would rather expect a higher salary when switching to remote.
>
> 2. Immaturity
>
>I believe you are looking for someone more mature in terms of making decisions. I feel like I still need a lot of mentoring, pair programming sessions, etc to become stand-alone. Talking about that, it seems better for me to stay in the office for some more time here in Lviv.
> 
> 
> What I want to add is that I highly appreciate your time and an offer itself and I would really like to stay in touch in order to arrange possible collaboration further - probably in a half of a year I will be ready to start working 100% remotely. Thank you for your consideration. 
> 
> BR,
> Dmytro.
