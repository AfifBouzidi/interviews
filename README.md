# Brief
At some point of my professional career, I've been through an endless path of interviews. There were some weeks when I had 4-6 interviews scheduled and that was not the limit I believe. There were some exceptions, but mostly they were quite standard: 15 minutes HR interview/selling the company to you, ~1h of technical interview (what is the difference between abstract class and an interface questions for an hour), your questions to the company and that's it. You get an offer, decline it and go for the next one. 

# My vision on interviews and why you should take those chances
  TODO

# So, what is that? 
I decided to arrange a list of fancy questions I've been asked during the interviews I had. They might be useful for you.
