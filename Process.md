# What is the usual process of technical interviews and what's so freaky about it

To be honest, the process is really non-trivial and you almost never see something outstanding. 
* Talent sourcer gets in touch with you
* You both setup a short meeting which is oftenly called pre-screening to get aquainted with each other and the company
* Next thing is n rounds of technical interviews where you really need to show your skills - algorithms, [Engineering Thinking](http://www.intuac.com/userport/john/writing/nthinking.html), system design, your knowledge of the market of tools available, etc etc etc
* If you are applying for a big fish and passed the previous parts successfully, you will be invited to attend onsite interviews. That means you will get a chance to see the city, office, meet with your potential future colleagues and have final interviews which are mostly more technical than previous ones. 
* Also, onsite stage includes some culture fit, soft skills, general attitude interviews. 

Usually, when applying for some middle outsourcing companies, you won't have really a lot of pressure on you or a lot of interviews. On the other hand, top CS companies such as Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc are able to do a selection through this multi-level interviewing process to be sure they get the best professionals as they have really a lot of people willing to work for them. 

Most of the times, the whole process takes like 3-4 weeks. Then you receive a feedback. 
As said, a lot of middle outsourcing companies don't give a shit about feedback so it's a good practice to ping recruiter in like ~2 weeks after the interview just to remind them that you are still waiting for the feedback. When you are going on interviews not entirely for the offer, but for the gap identifying, detailed and constructive feedback is really valuable, no matter the result. It enables you to master your skills and fill the gaps and become a better specialist in the end.
